I've usually used Vue.js or, more recently, Stimulus when I write JavaScript.

I'm familiar with JSX from using Astro for a previous version of my website and have experimented with Next.js, but haven't really learned React properly - but maybe I should.

School of Code - the bootcamp I mentor for - teach React and Drupal's new Experience Builder is written with React, so maybe now is the time.
