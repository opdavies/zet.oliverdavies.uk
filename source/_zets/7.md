Here are some quick notes from Ferdie De Oliveria's talk, "Scaling Personal Projects", at [PHP South West last week](https://www.meetup.com/php-sw/events/302521220):

- Create the project and change the name later. Don't let the project name be a blocker.
- Identify key features and functionality. Use a tool like a Trello board to capture and manage tasks.
- Ponder on the challenges.
- Have a growth mindset.
- Divide tasks into heavy work, medium work and quick wins.
- Fail fast, fail early.
- Refactor.
- Iterate.
- If people don't like it, make it better.
- Consistency is key.
- Practice and perseverance.
