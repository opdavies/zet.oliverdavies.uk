title: Excluding local files from Git

As well as using a shared `.gitignore` file in a directory, I've had a convention of putting my own files I want to ignore in an `.ignored` directory and having that in a [global excludes file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-coreexcludesFile).

This works for most situations, but sometimes files need to be in their expected location and not in a sub-directory.

I also have scripts that check for a file in both places before performing an action.

Git, though, has a built-in way to do this.

Any files added to `.git/info/exclude` will automatically be excluded by Git and because this is in my `.git` directory, it won't affect anyone else's version.
