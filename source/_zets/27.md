I've used Fractal a lot for the past several years to build design systems and component libraries for projects, but as the last commit was in January 2023 and there was an issue saying the maintainers were stepping back and the project is unmaintained, it may be time to look at something else.

Storybook seems to be the popular choice and it has an integration module with Drupal.
