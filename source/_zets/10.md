[git instafix](https://github.com/quodlibetor/git-instafix) is a tool that allows you to easily amend (or fix) previous Git commits.

How it works:

- Commit your original changes.
- Make more changes and stage them with `git add -p`.
- Run `git-instafix` (or `git instafix`, but this doesn't tab complete for me).
- Select the commit you want to amend.
- `git-instafix` will amend it and move you back to the HEAD commit.
