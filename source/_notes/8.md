[The PHPSW website](https://phpsw.uk) is one of the earliest Tailwind CSS projects I did, at least that I can remember.

Tailwind CSS [was added to the project](https://github.com/phpsw/phpsw-ng/commit/879c23153b1f80b9b037cf6299a9bc17a63b66bd) on the 13th of November, 2017 (almost 7 years ago), and the yarn.lock file shows the version as 0.1.6.

0.1.0 was only released [on the 1st of November](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and 1.0.0 wouldn't be released [until May 2019](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
