```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --insecure \
  --data '{"foo": "bar"}' \
  https://example.docker.localhost/webhook
```

`--request POST` is implied if `--data` is passed.

`--insecure` skips SSL validation, e.g. if using a self-signed certificate.

Also, from `man curl`:

```shell
--json works as a shortcut for passing on these three options:

--data [arg]
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--header "Accept: application/json"
```
