If you need to set `max_allowed_packet` for MariaDB, you can specify it in Docker Compose as a `command`.

For example:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.9.3
    command: --max_allowed_packet=1GB
    volumes:
      - "./backend_db/mariadb.storage:/var/lib/mysql"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    env_file: ./backend_db/mariadb.env
```

No Dockerfiles or configuration files needed.

It can't be more than 1GB, though.
