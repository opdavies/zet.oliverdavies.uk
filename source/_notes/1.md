```html
<ul> and <ol> must only directly contain <li>, <script> or <template> elements
Ensures that lists are structured correctly

more informationLink opens in a new window
Element Location:
.pager__items
<ul class="pager__items js-pager__items">
To solve this problem, you need to fix the following:
List element has direct children that are not allowed: [role=presentation]

Related Node
<li class="pager__item pager__item--ellipsis" role="presentation">â€¦</li>
```

Proposed resolution:

Replace `role="presentation"` with `aria-label="additional pages"`.
